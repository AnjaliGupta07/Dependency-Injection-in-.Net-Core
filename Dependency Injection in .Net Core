- ASP.NET Core is designed from scratch to support Dependency Injection. 
- ASP.NET Core injects objects of dependency classes through constructor or method by using built-in IoC container.
- ASP.NET Core framework contains simple out-of-the-box IoC container which does not have as many features as other third party IoC containers.
- If you want more features such as auto-registration, scanning, interceptors, or decorators then you may replace built-in IoC container with a third party container.
 
- ASP.NET Core allows us to register dependencies with IoC container, in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class.


- Let's understand how the built-in IoC container works internally. (https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/core/internals-of-builtin-ioc-container-in-aspnet-core)

The followings are important interfaces and classes for built-in IoC container:

Interfaces:
IServiceProvider
IServiceCollection

Classes:
ServiceProvider
ServiceCollection
ServiceDescription
ServiceCollectionServiceExtensions
ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions



Property Injection ??
Built-in IoC container does not support property injection. You will have to use third party IoC container.
